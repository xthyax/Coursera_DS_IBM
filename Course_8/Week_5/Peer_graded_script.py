# ## Story:
# 
# As a data analyst, you have been given a task to monitor and report US domestic airline flights performance. Goal is to analyze the performance of the reporting airline to improve fight reliability thereby improving customer relaibility.
# 
# Below are the key report items,
# 
# *   Yearly airline performance report 
# *   Yearly average flight delay statistics
# 
# *NOTE:* Year range is between 2005 and 2020.
# 
# ## Components of the report items
# 
# 1.  Yearly airline performance report
# 
#     For the chosen year provide,
# 
#     *   Number of flights under different cancellation categories using bar chart.
#     *   Average flight time by reporting airline using line chart.
#     *   Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline using pie chart.
#     *   Number of flights flying from each state using choropleth map.
#     *   Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline using treemap chart.
# 2.  Yearly average flight delay statistics
# 
#     For the chosen year provide,
# 
#     *   Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the given year.
#     *   Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the given year.
#     *   Monthly average natioanl air system delay by reporting airline for the given year.
#     *   Monthly average security delay by reporting airline for the given year.
#     *   Monthly average late aircraft delay by reporting airline for the given year.
# 
#     *NOTE:* You have worked created the same dashboard components in `Flight Delay Time Statistics Dashboard` section. We will be reusing the same.
# 
# ## Expected Layout
# 
# <center>
#     <img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%205/Layout.png" width="2000" alt="cognitiveclass.ai logo"/>
# </center>
# 
# %% [markdown]
# ## Requirements to create the dashboard
# 
# *   Create dropdown using the reference [here](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/dropdown?utm_medium=Exinfluencer\&utm_source=Exinfluencer\&utm_content=000026UJ\&utm_term=10006555\&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDV0101ENSkillsNetwork20297740-2021-01-01)
# *   Create two HTML divisions that can accomodate two components (in one division) side by side. One is HTML heading and the other one is dropdown.
# *   Add graph components.
# *   Callback function to compute data, create graph and return to the layout.
# 
# %% [markdown]
# ## What's new in this exercise compared to other labs?
# 
# *   Make sure the layout is clean without any defualt graphs or graph layouts. We will do this by 3 changes:
# 
#     1.  Add `app.config.suppress_callback_exceptions = True` right after `app = JupyterDash(__name__)`.
# 
#     2.  Having empty html.Div and use the callback to Output the dcc.graph as the Children of that Div.
# 
#     3.  Add a state variable in addition to callback decorator input and output parameter. This will allow us to pass extra values without firing the callbacks.
#         Here, we need to pass two inputs `chart type` and `year`. Input is read only after user entering all the information.
# 
# *   Use new html display style `flex` to arrange the dropdown menu with description.
# 
# *   Update app run step to avoid getting error message before initiating callback.
# 
# *NOTE:* These steps are only for review.
# 
# %% [markdown]
# ## Review
# 
# Search/Look for review to know how commands are used and computations are carried out. There are 7 review items.
# 
# *   REVIEW1: Clear the layout and do not display exception till callback gets executed.
# *   REVIEW2: Dropdown creation.
# *   REVIEW3: Observe how we add an empty division and providing an id that will be updated during callback.
# *   REVIEW4: Holding output state till user enters all the form information. In this case, it will be chart type and year.
# *   REVIEW5: Number of flights flying from each state using choropleth
# *   REVIEW6: Return dcc.Graph component to the empty division
# *   REVIEW7: This covers chart type 2 and we have completed this exercise under Flight Delay Time Statistics Dashboard section

# 
# *   Provide title of the dash application title as `US Domestic Airline Flights Performance`.
# *   Make the heading center aligned, set color as `#503D36`, and font size as `24`.
#     Sample: style={'textAlign': 'left', 'color': '#000000', 'font-size': 0}
# 
# ### TODO2

# Reference [link](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/dropdown?utm_medium=Exinfluencer\&utm_source=Exinfluencer\&utm_content=000026UJ\&utm_term=10006555\&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDV0101ENSkillsNetwork20297740-2021-01-01)
# 
# Create a dropdown menu and add two chart options to it.
# 
# Parameters to be updated in `dcc.Dropdown`:
# 
# *   Set `id` as `input-type`.
# *   Set `options` to list containing dictionaries with key as `label` and user provided value for labels in `value`.
# 
#     *1st dictionary*
# 
#     *   label: Yearly Airline Performance Report
#     *   value: OPT1
# 
#     *2nd dictionary*
# 
#     *   label: Yearly Airline Delay Report
#     *   value: OPT2
# *   Set placeholder to `Select a report type`.
# *   Set width as `80%`, padding as `3px`, font size as `20px`, text-align-last as `center` inside style parameter dictionary.
# 
# #### Skeleton:
# 
# ```
#   dcc.Dropdown(id='....',

# ```
# 
# ### TODO4
# 
# Our layout has 5 outputs so we need to create 5 output components. Review how input components are constructured to fill in for output component.
# 
# It is a list with 5 output parameters with component id and property. Here, the component property will be `children` as we have created empty division and passing in `dcc.Graph` after computation.
# 
# Component ids will be `plot1` , `plot2`, `plot2`, `plot4`, and `plot5`.
